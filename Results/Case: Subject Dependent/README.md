This folder contains results based on the subject-dependent study mode. The results are reported for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score,  AUC score, and MFCC metrics. Due to the imbalance nature of available multi-modal FoG dataset, for final evaluation of classification task, F1 score is proposed.
Two tables are provided, one for each SVM and RF classifiers, to observe the effect of different sensor combinations on the ability of classificier to accurately distinguish FoG episode from non-FoG episode. The results have shown that ACC sensor has high potential in detection FoG episodes for both classifiers abovementioned.
